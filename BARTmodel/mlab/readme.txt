Basic setup: unzip this file in any directory. The programming is in /mlab/. The data and output should be in the /input_output/ directory. Set the path of matlab to the optimize folder in /mlab/.The parameters are written to /input_output/modelestimates/.This is the programming for running the best fitting model from Wallsten, Pleskac, Lejuez (2005).It assumes that It assumes DMs evaluate%their potential options of stopping or pumping before each balloon and%select the pump that will maximize their earnings. After each balloon they%can learn (know = 0) about the balloon. However, they assume the%probability of an explosion is a stationary sample-with-replacement%structure. There are 4 parameters:beta: response sensitivitygamma: measure of diminishing sensitivity to gainsa0: beta dis parameterb0: beta dis parameterphat = f(a0,b0): measure of optimisimvar(phat) = f(a0,b0): measure of confidenceTo run the models the main file is:optimize_BART.m.You need to have a data file that is formatted like below:% sub     block   balloon pump    explode or not% 1       1       1       40      0% 1       1       2       62      0% .% .% .% 1       1       30       8      1% 2       1       1       34      0% .% .% .% numSub  1       30      28      1It is commented up, but essentially in the script file you select the model you want to run. Itthen does a for loop finding MLE parameters for the specified model. It rights a .txt and a .matfile to the directory ../../input_output/modelestimates/.The process goes through 3 steps for 4^3 loops (I select start values from 3 different sectors of theparameter space):1.) Selects a set of start values.2.) Checks to make sure the start values give a LogLikelihood value above a minimum criterion. 	If they are not then the a little noise is added to the start values to see if they can get	shaken out of the poor value. If they are o.k. then they are entered into fminsearch.The output that comes out is sub    beta    gamma   a0  b0  phat    var(phat)   loglike	numloops   numsuccess  foundmin    timedout	log_like_baseline  prob_pump   adjBART medianBART  stdevPumps	proppumpsee above for description of parameter estimates.
